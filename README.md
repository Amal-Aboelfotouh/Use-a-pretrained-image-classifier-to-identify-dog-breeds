# Dog Breed Classifier

This project leverages a pretrained image classifier to identify different dog breeds from images. Using state-of-the-art deep learning models, the classifier provides accurate predictions for a wide range of dog breeds. The project is designed to be user-friendly, scalable, and easily customizable.

## Features

- **Pretrained Model**: Utilizes a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, such as ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet, for robust feature extraction and classification.
- **Wide Range of Breeds**: Supports classification for numerous dog breeds.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of dogs to get breed predictions.
- **High Accuracy**: Built on models trained on large datasets like ImageNet or Stanford Dogs Dataset.
- **Customizable**: Can be fine-tuned for additional breeds or integrated into larger applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip or conda package manager
- GPU support (optional but recommended for faster inference)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-breed-classifier.git
   cd dog-breed-classifier
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pretrained model (if not included in the repository). Links to pretrained weights can be found [here](#pretrained-models).

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

To classify a single image:
```bash
python classify.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
```

### Example Output
```bash
Predicted Breed: Golden Retriever
Confidence: 95.3%
```

### Web Interface (Optional)
A web-based interface can be started for easy image uploads:
```bash
python app.py
```
Then visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

## Pretrained Models

- **ResNet50**
- **VGG16**
- **MobileNetV2**

Links to download these models and their weights are provided in the [models](models/) directory.

## Dataset
This project can be extended with your custom dataset. To train or fine-tune the model, organize your dataset into the following structure:
```
/dataset
  /train
    /breed1
    /breed2
  /validation
    /breed1
    /breed2
```

Then run the training script:
```bash
python train.py --dataset_path /path/to/dataset
```
